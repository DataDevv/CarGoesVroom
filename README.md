## About The Game

In Dasher Blitz, you navigate as a miniature car in an enormous world. Your goal is simple - pick up orders from various restaurants and deliver food to suitable houses. Our project is a driving simulator game that will allow for a single-driver vehicle that will be able to detect and avoid collisions realistically. It would also include playability features, allowing users to improve speed and agility performance over time and through multiple game runs. The ability to improve in-game mechanics and achieve higher speeds and a noticeable increase in each performance would allow users to enjoy a process of continual growth within the game. The projectâ€™s outcome is to produce a driving simulation game that can entertain primary users and provide an enjoyable gaming experience.
