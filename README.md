# Delivery Blitz
Our project is a driving simulator game that will allow for a single-driver vehicle that will be able to 
detect and avoid collisions in a realistic way. It would also include playability features to allow users to improve in speed 
and agility performance over time and through multiple runs of the game. The ability to improve in game mechanics and achieve
higher speeds and an observable increase in each performance would allow users to enjoy a process of continual growth within the game. 
The projectâ€™s outcome is to produce a driving simulation game that is able to entertain primary users and provide an enjoyable gaming experience.

# Dependencies
No dependencies are required as we will be deploying the game as an .exe for anyone to download.
